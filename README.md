## REST TODO LIST

### **Status: Work In Progress**

#### Details

I'll quickly go over the details of this project. As this is a work in progress I'll update the README file as needed.

1. This is a back-end project making use of Node.js
2. This uses Hapi js. I chose it over Express as this framework exists primarily for making APIs. 
3. MySQL is made use of as the database.
4. Unit testing is performed through mocha and chai.
5. Database credentials are not part of the source code and won't be committed.
